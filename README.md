# Customer Churn Prediction with Azure ML: <br /> From Data to Productionalized Model

This repository contains an end-to-end ML lifecycle demo using the Azure Maching Learning Studio.

Different features of the Azure Machine Learning Studio will be shown while working to solve a Kaggle challenge to predict customer churn. The Kaggle challenge can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn.

Prerequisites to rebuild the demo:
